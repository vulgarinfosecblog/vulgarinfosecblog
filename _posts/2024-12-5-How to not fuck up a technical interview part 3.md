INTERVIEW STRATEGY

There are all sorts of guides on the internet about how to 'aCe An InTeRvIeW'. So are my two cents really necessary? Not really. Do I have half-baked ideas in my fully-baked brain? Certainly. Additional word-vomit incoming.

For fucks sake. Aspirational (and professional) 'Cyber Security Analysts' seem to apply their analytical skills in a very narrow scope. These people are often able apply creativity and critical thinking to the problems they're familiar with- an identity that logged in from an IP in Shitstainogorsk Oblast, an EDR alert for a file named 'imtotallylegitbro.exe'. However, interviews seem to have a way of deleting a candidates's critical thinking similar to how an FPV drone deletes the existence of a Russian conscript.

Is it interview nerves? Maybe. I don't know. I don't really get nerves. Frankly, for the most part, I enjoy interviews. Generally, people are unwilling to give you an audiance to talk about how smart you are. When I've tried this, people generally find it arrogant and annoying. I can go on for hours about infosec. Hence the existence of this blog.

Your interviewer has an objective. They (in a perfect world) are looking to find and hire the strongest candidate for the least amount of budget. In the real world, some companies have other stupid incentives in the hiring process, such as DEI initiatives, that gives some candidates an advantage over others. For the purposes of this discussion (and to keep this from becoming a partisan rant), we'll forget about these other incentives. Strongest candidate. Least $.

You have an objective. You need money. Cash. Skrill. Being broke fucking sucks. You tried trading options. You generously donated a hedge fund manager's country club membership fee. Pulling tricks behind Wendy's dumpster is not an attractive prospect. Starving is also not an attractive prospect. You've heard of the promised land of milk and honey, where remote jobs grow on trees, and you can mostly jerk off all day and get paid big dough. Cyber Security.

So you want to get an infosec job. If you're a real chad, you'll get multiple remote infosec jobs and work all of them at the same time. Before you know it, you'll be trapped by lifestyle creep since you've married a golddigger instagram model with massive bolt-ons, taken out a massive loan on a giant house (or if you live in Vancouver/Toronto, a diminuitive condo) and a Ferrari. All 3 jobs have their EDR agents BSOD all the Windows machines at each company at the same time. Sudden coronary failure takes your life, and your golddigger wife takes all your money. Legend status.

Oh yeah, interview strategy. The interviewer will determine the strongest candidate based on how the candidate fared in interviews. I find infosec interviews generally fall into two categories-

- Technical interviews (do you actually have the knowledge to do the job)
- Culture interviews (are you a complete asshole that nobody likes)

The previous post went deep into specific technical gaps I've personally observed, but I wanted to write a seperate post regarding the higher-level strategy that applies to both technical and culture interviews. 

A good infosec technical interview uses a few techniques to seperate the wheat from the chaff. The men from the boys. The enriched weapons-grade plutonium isotope from the nuclear fuel. 

- Scenarios (as implied in the previous post- 'what would you do if you encountered XYZ situtation'?)
- Direct Questions (what service runs on port 53?)
- CV directed (tell me about your experience with tool ABC or company XYZ)

Prepare for the interviewer to use all of these techniques. For me, answers to the 'Scenario' questions are the most important. I want to see a candidate's thought process (or lack thereof). I give them a problem. What do they come up with as a solution? Can they learn and adapt? Or is the candidate a buzzword and cliche machine? Conditional jump to the Marc-Andre Fleury subroutine.

General knowledge is important as well, but you can learn that on the job. Google exists for a reason. But if you fail at thinking through problems, I will not hire you.

So that brings us back to strategy. I've given you the insider knowledge on what we're looking for in a candidate. It's not a secret, and often HR will even tell you what the company is looking for in the job description (although given the mean intelligence level of the average HR grunt, this doesn't always happen). Use your analytical ability to tailor your strategy to make yourself the strongest candidate. If you do not possess this analytical ability, how the fuck do you think you are going to stop computer hackers? I think a lot of people we interview possess this analytical ability, but as I mentioned at the start, people don't bring that analytical ability into the interview room. Of course, there are also outright morons.

Last point. It is possible to do everything perfect, and still fail. Life sucks. It's fucking hard. Whining about it on the internet doesn't help you. Take a hike. Interviews are not a perfect science. From personal experience, I've been through interview processes that I thought went excellent, only to get ghosted. Shit happens. Don't take it personally.

That last point seemed almost optimistic. Look at me, fucking ray of sunshine. Fuck you.
