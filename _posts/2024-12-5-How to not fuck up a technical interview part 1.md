title: How to not fuck up a technical interview - Part 1
categories: Interview

INTRODUCTION

Recently my beloved organization has been attempting to fulfill a 'Cyber Security Analyst' role. My experiences in interviews in the past have always been on the other side of the table, and I like to think I've got reasonably okay at doing interviews to grift companies into giving me money. Now that I've gone a few years having done enough at my org to not get shitcanned, I'm considered somewhat 'Senior', and the boss tapped me on the shoulder to tag in to work the other side of the desk in a few technical interviews.

I would like to preface what I'm about to say with some context regarding my organization. We're not big-name FAANG-fuckers. We're not offering a semi-inducing salary. Despite what HR retards write in job postings (that's a topic for another day), we're not expecting reincarnated Kevin Mitnick. However, my org does have some benefits, such as full remote work (which this position is). Not some bullshit hybrid stupidity, full-fat, no fucking around REMOTE. I was under the impression that this benefit (which according to the mass of collective human failure known as Reddit) was becoming ever more rare and sought after. According to the laws of Supply & Command, this should mean that both quality & quantity of applicants should be better & larger, respectively.

The quantity side of the equation is not an issue. Unfortunately Joe Steel's (may he rest in hell) old maxim of 'Quantity has a Quality all of it's own' applies about as well to infosec as a wallstreetbets post does to the actual stock market. 

The issue (and the whole reason I'm bothered to type all this literary vomit) is Quality. More specifically-

- Technical Knowledge (how the fuck do so-called 'Cybersecurity Analysts' have no idea what Mimikatz does?)
- Describing their experience (why is nobody prepared for 'Whats the most interesting/challenging incident you've dealt with?')
- Developing rapport

I'm writing this post in a likely vain, frankly quite pathetic effort to try to address the quality shortfall we're dealing with. This post is a half-introduction & half-rant regarding this issue, but I'll get off my lazy ass and write a few more posts and get into the Meat & Potatoes of the topic. More specifically-

Part 2- Technical knowledge. Fundamentals. Simple shit. 
Part 3- Interview Strategy.
Part 4- Social Engineering. Touchy-feely. Nobody hires someone they already hate talking to in a 45-minute interview.

Are you one of the annoying fuckheads that whine about how they can't get a job on Reddit? Quit your fucking pity party, shut the fuck up about 'tHe EcOnOmY', nobody gives a fuck. Read my next three posts. Consume them. Understand them. Ace your next interview for a cushy high-paying infosec job, make a fuckload of cash, YOLO into 0DTE $TSLA Puts and lose it all. See you behind Wendy's dumpster.

Fuck right off.
